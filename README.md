# 🕵️ Detection Engineering Lab

A collection of detection logic, SIGMA rules, log analysis exercises, and MITRE ATT&CK–mapped detections. This repo demonstrates hands-on detection engineering and blue-team analysis skills.

## 🔍 Features
- SIGMA rules
- Correlation searches
- Log parsing with Python
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Detection validation
- Incident simulations
- Hunt queries & detection logic

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `sigma-rules/` – Standardized SIGMA rules
- `detections/` – Detection logic explanations and mappings
- `logs/` – Sample event logs used for testing detections
- `reports/` – Incident analysis and validation reports

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build real-world detections
- Parse and enrich logs
- Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK
- Document high-fidelity alerts and reduce noise
